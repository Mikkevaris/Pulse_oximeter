# Pulse_oximeter
Implementing a working pulse oximeter capable of estimating heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. In this project, we utilize Arduino Uno and MAX30102 chip, an integrated pulse oximetry and heart rate monitor module. The datasheet can be found here: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max30102.pdf
